 JDatPacker
============

JDatPacker is a simple cross-platform utility for repackaging SimCity 4
plugin files to few dat files. It is an alternative to the original
[SC4DatPacker](http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=26)
by wouanagaine.


 Requirements
--------------

This program requires Java 1.6 or later.


 Installation & Usage
----------------------

Simply unpack the zip archive and double click the jar file to start the
application. An installation is not required.

Specify the source (usually outside your plugins folder) and target
directories (usually inside your plugins folder). Each top-level folder
inside of the source directory will get bundled to one dat file that is
written to the target directory. Files larger than 500 MiB will be split.
