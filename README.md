 JDatPacker
============

JDatPacker is a cross-platform utility for repackaging SimCity 4
plugin files into larger .dat files. It is an alternative to the original
[SC4DatPacker](http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=26)
by wouanagaine.


 Requirements
--------------

This program requires Java 8 or later.


 Installation & Usage
----------------------

Simply unpack the zip archive and double click the jar file to start the
application. An installation is not necessary.

Specify the source directory (usually outside your plugins folder) and target
directory (usually inside your plugins folder). Each top-level folder
contained in the source directory is bundled into a single .dat file
which then is saved inside the target directory. Files larger than 500 MiB will be split.
